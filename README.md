# RestApi
a simple REST API for a catalog of products

# Softwares Used
This application provides a simple API to provide product information
and complete given commands on them. I used Python to create 
the application with FastApi. I used uvicorn as a server to 
connect the program to a local host/port number. 

# How It Works 
So the application has the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE functions to 
interact with the product informations.
